# What is Vite Router Next
If you are a big fan of both [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) and [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/), and you want to use **Next.js App Router** but only want **CSR (Client Side Rendering)**, then **Vite Router Next** is what you are looking for.

**Vite Next Router** provides similar features to **Next App Router**, based on [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) & [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/).
